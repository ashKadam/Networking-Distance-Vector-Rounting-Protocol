# Networking-Distance-Vector-Rounting-Protocol
Implementation of Distance Vector Routing Protocol in Java.

In this project, you will implement the distance vector routing protocol. Your program will be running either at several different machines (preferred) or in a single machine (simulation). At each router, the input to your program is the set of directly attached links and their costs. Note that the program at each host doesn't know the complete network topology. Your routing program at each router should report the cost and the next hop for the shortest paths to all other routers in the network.

Instead of implementing the exact distance vector routing protocol described in the textbook, you are asked to implement a variation of the protocol. In this protocol, each host sends out the routing information to its neighbors at a certain frequency (once every 15 seconds), regardless whether the information has changed since the last announcement. This strategy improves the robustness of the protocol. For instance, a lost message will be automatically recovered by later messages. In this strategy, typically a host re-computes its distance vector and routing table right before sending out the routing information to its neighbors.
